# API

## Overview

All access is over HTTPS, and access from the "WHATEVER URL" domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

## Access Token

Every request requires an authentication token to be provided in the header.

To do this make sure you set 'Access-Token' equal to the user's access token in every request except for SIGNUP and LOGIN.
